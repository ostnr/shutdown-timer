# Shutdown Timer

Shutdown Timer is a simple, user-friendly Python application that allows you to schedule a system shutdown with a customizable countdown timer. Built with tkinter, this application provides an intuitive graphical interface for managing your computer's shutdown process.

## Features

- Set a custom shutdown timer (default: 40 minutes)
- Start, pause, and continue the countdown
- Adjust the timer by adding or subtracting 10 minutes
- Force shutdown option
- Test mode for simulating shutdown without actually turning off your computer
- Colorful button borders for easy functionality recognition

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. No additional dependencies are required as the application uses built-in Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```
   python shutdown_timer.py
   ```

2. Use the interface to set your desired shutdown time:
   - Click "Start Timer" to begin the countdown
   - Use "+10 min" and "-10 min" buttons to adjust the time
   - Click "Pause" to temporarily stop the countdown, and "Continue" to resume
   - Check "Force Shutdown" to force close all applications during shutdown
   - Enable "Test Mode" to simulate shutdown without actually turning off your computer (debug feature)
